# AbsolutistTT
Tesk task for Absolutist

Task:
"Using Actionscript3.0 create example that has a dragable graphic object in the center of the screen.
When you click on this object with the mouse, it changes its view and draging begins.
When you release the mouse button, the object takes its original view and position."

Decision: 
To create this app I use Adobe Flash Builder, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate.

First of all I deploy a main structure of project with Flash Builder and create 2d model of my object using Photoshop and Animate.
Than using Adobe Animate I exported the .swc library to my project. And finaly I finished writing the program code.
